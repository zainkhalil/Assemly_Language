<h3>WHAT IS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE:  </h3>
<P>Assembly programming language is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs for specific computer architectures or microprocessors.Unlike high-level programming languages, which use human-readable syntax and are closer to natural language, assembly language is a more direct representation of the machine code instructions understood by the computer's CPU.In assembly language, each instruction corresponds to a specific operation that the CPU can execute. These operations include basic tasks like loading data from memory, performing arithmetic or logical operations, and storing data back to memory. </P>
